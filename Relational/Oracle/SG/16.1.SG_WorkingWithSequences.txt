### create sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE runner_id_seq
INCREMENT BY 1
START WITH 1
MAXVALUE 50000
NOCACHE
NOCYCLE;

### confirm sequence
SELECT * FROM user_sequences;
SELECT sequence_name, min_value, max_value, increment_by, last_number FROM user_sequences;

### NEXTVAL
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name, location_id) VALUES (departments_seq.NEXTVAL, 'Support', 2500);

### create table runner
CREATE TABLE runners

first_name VARCHAR2(30),
last_name VARCHAR2(30)
);

### insert into runners table
INSERT INTO runners (runner_id, first_name, last_name) VALUES (runner_id_seq.NEXTVAL, 'Joanne', 'Everely');
INSERT INTO runners (runner_id, first_name, last_name) VALUES (runner_id_seq.NEXTVAL, 'Adam', 'Curtis');

### CURRVAL and NEXTVAL
# following syntax will increase/decrease sequence even though sequence not used by table
SELECT runner_id_seq.CURRVAL FROM DUAL;
SELECT runner_id_seq.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL;

### modifiying a sequence
ALTER SEQUENCE runner_id_seq
INCREMENT BY 1
MAXVALUE 999999
