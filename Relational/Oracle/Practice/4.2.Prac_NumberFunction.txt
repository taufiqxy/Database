### Display Oracle database employee last_name and salary for employee_ids between 100 and 102.
### Include a third column that divides each salary by 1.55 and rounds the result to two decimal places.
SELECT last_name, salary, ROUND(salary/1.55, 2) FROM employees WHERE employee_id BETWEEN 100 AND 102;

### Display employee last_name and salary for those employees who work in department 80.
### Give each of them a raise of 5.333% and truncate the result to two decimal places.
SELECT last_name, salary, TRUNC(salary + (salary * 0.05333), 2) AS "Raise" FROM employees WHERE department_id = 80;

### Use a MOD number function to determine whether 38873 is an even number or an odd number.
SELECT MOD(38873, 2) FROM DUAL;

### Use the DUAL table to process the following numbers:
### 845.553 - round to one decimal place
### 30695.348 - round to two decimal places
### 30695.348 - round to -2 decimal places
### 2.3454 - truncate the 454 from the decimal place
SELECT ROUND(845.553, 1) FROM DUAL;
SELECT ROUND(30695.348, 2) FROM DUAL;
SELECT ROUND(30695.348, -2) FROM DUAL;
SELECT TRUNC(2.3454, 1) FROM DUAL;

### Divide each employee’s salary by 3. Display only those employees’ last names and salaries who earn a salary that is a multiple of 3.
SELECT last_name, salary, salary/3 FROM employees WHERE MOD(salary/3, 3) = 0;

### Divide 34 by 8. Show only the remainder of the division. Name the output as EXAMPLE.
SELECT MOD(34, 8) AS "EXAMPLE" FROM DUAL;
